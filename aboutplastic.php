Interestingly, nations like Kenya and France are phasing out single-use plastic bag by banning its products. Infractions with these products are heavily penalized and could send you to jail..</p>

            <p class="original">Microplastics" is a highly complex topic with many causes and many levers - actually far too complicated for school, not yet fully </p>

            <p class="extra">researched scientifically and yet a topic of the future and on everyone's lips. It is precisely these topics that belong in schools and institutes and this is where WASoMI comes in.Schools and institutes are an ideal place to provide impetus for sustainable action. That's why we bring our expertise on microplastics and our commitment to environmental protection into the classrooms. We are convinced that together with teachers, lecturers, participants, and students we can achieve much more for Water without Microplastics.</p>

            <h3>Magnetic oil</h3>
            <p class="original">Scientists have created a magnetic coil that is able to target microplastics in the ocean. This experimental nanotechnology is able to break down microplastic in the water without causing  any harm to marine life.</p>
            <span class="dots">...</span>
            <p class="extra">Thinner than a human hair, these coils resemble bed springs under a microscope, and are coated in nitrogen and a magnetic metal called manganese. When they react with oxygen molecules, they attack plastic and can help to break it down. Xiaoguang Duan, a co-author of this study found that nano-coils have a 30% to 50% reduction rate in microplastics over a period of eight hours in early experiments. </p>
